# Card Counting Simulator

This application can be used to discern profitability levels of card counting strategies for the game of Blackjack. Based on user inputs, such as betting amount strategies based on card counts, it will run simulations and return the profit results. It additionally will give you statistical testing results to show you how significant the profit level is relative to a breakeven strategy. 

Further information on statistical testing can be found on this [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_hypothesis_testing).
Essentially, you are looking for a small p-value to have a stronger confidence that your strategy may be statistically significant and winning.

Simulation uses standard Vegas rules i.e: hit soft 17, blackjack pays 3 to 2, late surrender allowed, split aces allowed, double and split allowed upto 4 hands.
